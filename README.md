### Django Rest Framework (DRF) CFE Course
[Course Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c708Nf0cHrs&t=19818s )
This repo is the source code of a Coding for Entrepreneurs course. I pushed the codes from the begining of the course and after each section I watched I added a new commit. <br>
I highly recommend this course especially for beginners. <br>
Happy coding :) <br>
